# Luxmeter created programming Arduino in Assembly
This repository contains the code and documentation for a luxmeter project developed as part of a university course requirement. The project involved programming an Arduino in Assembly language, showcasing the integration of low-level programming with hardware components to measure light intensity.

Thanks to the professor for providing a portion of the code and the detailed instructions for interfacing Arduino with Atmel Studio.

## Instructions

We have included detailed instructions for configuring and operating the Arduino through Atmel Studio. These instructions are crucial for anyone looking to replicate the project or understand the programming and setup process.

## Circuit Information

The complete circuit details, including schematics, component specifications, and assembly instructions, are contained in the final report. Due to academic requirements, the report is written in Italian.
