# Luxmeter Programmed in Assembly Using Arduino
This repository contains code and documentation for a luxmeter project developed as part of a university course requirement. The project involved programming an Arduino in Assembly language, showcasing the integration of low-level programming with hardware components to measure light intensity.

Thanks to the professor for providing a portion of the code and the detailed instructions for interfacing Arduino with Atmel Studio.

## Instructions

Detailed instructions for configuring and operating the Arduino through Atmel Studio are included in this repository.

## Circuit Information

The complete circuit details, including schematics, component specifications, and assembly instructions, are contained in the final report. Due to academic requirements, the report is written in Italian.
